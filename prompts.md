1] prompt for full context

I want you to create a full backend using Spring Boot for a product-based web application. It should have user registration and login features using JWT tokens. Public access should be allowed only for login and registration, and all other API routes should be protected. The app should let users perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on products. Use a MySQL database. Add a User and a Product entity, their repositories, and services. Include JWT utility classes to generate and validate tokens, and apply a JWT filter to check tokens in every request. Also, create unit tests for authentication and product features using JUnit and MockMvc. Add all necessary configuration files like SecurityConfig.java, application.properties, and the required annotations.
